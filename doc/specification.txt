THE SPEC:


  We have three layers: an Entropy layer, a PRF layer and a PRNG layer.

  The Entropy layer:

    We assume one or more high-quality but slow sources of random bytes
    from the operating system, CPU, or another source.  We label them
    Entropy_1 through Entropy_N for some N.

    When use the i'th entropy source to generate an n-byte value, we say:
      ENTROPY_i(n) -> bytes

  The PRF layer:

    The pesudorandom function, PRF, is a function taking an KEY_LEN byte
    key and a N_ctr bit counter, and producing PRF_OUTPUT_LEN bytes of
    output for each counter value.

    We say PRF(key,ctr) -> bytes.

    Our actual pseudorandom function is the core of either ChaCha8,
    ChaCha12, or ChaCha20, with a 40-byte key and a 32-bit counter,
    producing 64 bytes of output per counter value.  (We never use the
    high 32 bits of the ChaCha counter; we split the 40 byte key into a
    32-byte ChaCha key and an 8 byte ChaCha nonce. This probably doesn't
    actually get 320-bit security.)

    Sometimes we generate multiple PRF output blocks at once.  When we
    do, we write it as:
       PRF(key,ctr..ctr+N) -> bytes
    which is equivalent to
       PRF(key,ctr) || PRF(key,ctr+1) || ... || PRF(key,ctr+N)
    where || denotes concatenation.

    We require that KEY_LEN be even.

  The PRNG layer:

    The PRNG has a state consisting of a PRF key K and a
    buffer BUF of up to BUF_LEN bytes, where BUF_LEN + KEY_LEN is equal to
    N_BLOCKS * PRF_OUTPUT_LEN for some N_BLOCKS >= 1.

    We write a PRNG state as (K, BUF).

    To "Stir" the PRNG, replace its state as follows:
        Generate  PRF(K, 0..(N_BLOCKS-1)) -> Output
        Take the first KEY_LEN bytes of Output as the new value of K.
        Take the remainder of Output as the new value of BUF.

    To "Construct" a PRNG:
        Construct a PRNG state as (ENTROPY_1(KEY_LEN), nil).

        Then let S = ENTROPY_2(KEY_LEN) ||
                     ENTROPY_3(KEY_LEN) || ... ENTROPY_N(KEY_LEN)
        where || denotes concatenation.

        Then invoke the "Add" procedure below to add "N" bytes of
        seed to the state.


    "Removing" N bytes from BUF means to extract the first N bytes of
    BUF, deleting them from the buffer.  If possible, this deletion
    should be done destructively, so that the bytes no longer exist
    in the underlying memory.

    To fulfill a "Tiny Request of N bytes" from the PRNG state:
    (for N much less than BUF_LEN)
        If there are fewer than N bytes in BUF, then Stir the PRNG.
        Remove the first N bytes from BUF, and give them to the user.

    [The above approach is used for requests for small integers of known
    size.]

    To fulfill a "Small Request" of N bytes, where N is no more than
    BUF_LEN + Len(BUF) - 1
        If N is less than Len(BUF):
            Remove and return N bytes from BUF.
        Else:
            Let A = BUF.
            Stir the RNG.
            Let B = Remove  N - Len(A) bytes from BUF.
            Return A || B

    To fulfill a "Big Request" of N bytes, for N greater than or equal
    to BUF_LEN:
        Let A = the entire contents of BUF.
        Let BYTES_NEEDED = (N + KEY_LEN - Len(A))
        Let BLOCK_LEN = N_BLOCKS * PRF_OUTPUT_LEN
        Let BLOCKS_NEEDED = BYTES_NEEDED divided by BLOCK_LEN, rounding up.

        Let OUTPUT = PRF(K, 0..((N_BLOCKS*BLOCKS_NEEDED)-1))
        Divide OUTPUT into:
             B = the first (N_BLOCKS-1) * BLOCK_LEN bytes of OUTPUT.
             K' = The next KEY_LEN bytes of OUTPUT
             BUF' = The remainder of OUTPUT.

        Let N' = N - Len(B) - Len(A)
        Let C = Remove N' bytes from BUF'.
        Replace K with K'; replace BUF with BUF'.  If BUF is empty, Stir.
        Return A || B || C.

     To "Get N Random Bytes":
         Provide those bytes as a "Small request" if can, and if not,
         treat it as a "Big request".

     To "Add" N bytes of additional seed S to the state:

        Pad S with 0 bytes to a multiple of KEY_LEN/2.

        While S is nonempty:
          Let X = the first KEY_LEN bytes of PRF(K, 0).
          Let Y = Remove the first KEY_LEN/2 bytes from S.
          XOR Y into the first KEY_LEN/2 bytes of X.

        Stir.



     The public API consists of the operations above named "Add", "Get N
     Random bytes", and "Construct", "Tiny Request of 4 bytes", and "Tiny
     Request of 8 bytes".
