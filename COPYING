Libottery contains two implementations of the ChaCha stream cipher: a fast
one by Ted Krovetz and an extra-portable one by Dan Bernstein.  They are both
in the public domain.  See doc/krovetz/readme.txt for Ted Krovetz's public
domain dedication.

Some of the unit tests for Libottery use the tinytest test
infrastructure. See test/tinytest.c for the license that tinytest uses.  This
license applies only to the files test/tinytest.c, test/tinytest.h, and
test_tinytest_macros.c; it does not affect the rest of Libottery.

The m4/ax_pthread.m4 autoconf macro is under the GPLv3, modified with a
special exception to not place any requirementso on the generated "configure"
file; see that file for more information. Its license does not affect the
status of any other portion of Libottery.
